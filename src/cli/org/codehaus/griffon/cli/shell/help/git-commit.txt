DESCRIPTION
        git-commit

	Record changes to the repository.

SYNTAX
        git-commit [options]

OPTIONS
        --all, -a
                Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you
                have not told git about are not affected.
        --amend
                Used to amend the tip of the current branch. Prepare the tree object you would want to replace the latest
                commit as usual (this includes the usual -i/-o and explicit paths), and the commit log editor is seeded
                with the commit message from the tip of the current branch. The commit you create replaces the current
                tip -- if it was a merge it will have the parents of the current tip as parents -- so the current top
                commit is discarded.
        --message, -m
                Use the given <msg> as the commit message.
        --non-interactive
                Controls if the shell can ask for input or not.
