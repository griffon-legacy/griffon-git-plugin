DESCRIPTION
        git-push

	Update remote refs along with associated objects.

SYNTAX
        git-push [options] [remote]

ARGUMENTS
        remote
                The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL or
                the name of a remote.

OPTIONS
        --all
                Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under refs/heads/ be pushed.
        --force, -f
                Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to
                overwrite it. This flag disables the check. This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it
                with care.
        --non-interactive
                Controls if the shell can ask for input or not.
        --tags
                All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.
